# MLModelDeploy
This project was developed in order to practice web development basics, including html and css setup and development with Flask.
The goal of the project was to perform a basic deployment of a machine learning model trained previously. All analytics contemplated by this model are descripted at https://www.kaggle.com/code/devassaxd/star-classification-with-a-twist.
Here we simply ask the user for inputs regarding the star they want to classify, and using this information we use the model saved to classify the input and, if possible, also present some interesting features the star has when compared to the whole database
